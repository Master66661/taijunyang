                    <h3>PRINCIPALS MESSAGE</h3>
                    <p>As an accomplished education institution dedicated to cultivating 1st<br>
                       Class Honours graduates, we are guided by our belief in providing a <br>

                    <h3>Governance</h3>
                    <p>As Ninepercent College continues to move into an fun and exciting <br>
                        future full of promise, we also continue to employ sound leadership<br>
                        and strict governance to ensure that we always meet and exceed the <br>
                        highest standards in the quality of our academic programmes, our <br>
                        students experience, our administration and our policies.<br>
                        The Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025 (Higher Education) laid <br>
                        out ten shifts in higher education institutions in Malaysia. The <br>
                        sixth of these, Empowered Governance, gives higher education <br>
                        institutions autonomy, greater decision-making rights, and greater <br>
                        accountability. With the power and flexibility to make our own <br>
                        decisions, we can now better manage our resources and evolve our <br>
                        institution into one that is more innovative, more effective, and <br>
                        more responsive. Consistent with Ninepercent vision, mission and <br>
                        core values, we pursue our strategic objectives through this <br>
                        empowerment and operate within the framework prescribed by Act 555<br>

                        The highest academic governing body at the college level is the <br>
                        College Academic Council, established by Ninepercent Board of <br>
                        Governors in accordance with the College Constitution. This Council, <br>
                        among others, ensures that the academic integrity and quality of <br>
                        our academic operations are never compromised and that they work in <br>
                        tandem with our education strategy.<br>
